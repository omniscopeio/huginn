      <h2>What is Huginn?</h2>
      <p>
        Huginn is a service designed to let you connect the internet in ways 
        that are interesting and relevant to you. If you want to know when it
        will rain, or when the world is tweeting about your favorite celebrity,
        then Huginn is for you. We have dozens of agents  to help you be 
        productive and more are being added all the time. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Huginn is also <a href="https://github.com/cantino/huginn" target="_blank">open source software and is hosted on Github</a>. 
        That means you can help make it better. If there's an agent 
        you want to see, or you want to help out, you can! It also means that 
        if you build your life around Huginn you never have to worry 
        about Omniscope closing up shop because you can always run Huginn yourself.
      </p>
      <h2>What is Omniscope?</h2>
      <p>
        In 2015, one of the core maintainers of Huginn put a call out for
        someone to run a hosted, public instance of Huginn. There were roughly
        10,000 people on Github following the Huginn repo and one of the big 
        barriers to adoption that he saw was the need to deploy Huginn before
        seeing it in action. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Omniscope answered that call. We forked the open source code, added 
        a payment gateway to help cover our costs, made some contributions
        back to the core project, and here we are. We hope this gets you
        into Huginn faster than ever before and that you find this instance 
        meaningful. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Omniscope is dedicated to making you 
        more productive. In addition to Huginn, we are experts in 
        leadership coaching, and have extensive experience with personal
        feedback in the workplace.
